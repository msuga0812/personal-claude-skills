## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Please report vulnerabilities using GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

If private reporting is unavailable, open an issue with the title prefix `[SECURITY]` and include only minimal information (no exploit details). A maintainer will move the discussion to a private channel.

## Response Expectations

- Initial response target: within 72 hours
- Triage and severity assessment: within 7 days
- Fix timeline: depends on severity and impact
